## Description
Welcome to Harry Potter RPG, an RPG game powered by jQuery. 

## Rules
The player makes a selection from Harry, Hagrid, Dumbledore, and Voldemort and has his/her character battle the other characters in succession. The goal is to be able to defeat all three oponents in a row without your own HP dropping to 0. Since the player character gains a 50% boost in strength after every attack the general strategy is to fight weaker players first so you can build up your attack power and defeat tougher enemies later.

## Game Flow

1. Select your character
2. Select your opponent
3. Do battle with the "Fight" button
  -Your character attacks first then the opponent attacks second
  -Damage is calculated by a character's ATK power minus Defender's HP
  -A character loses when their HP reaches 0
4. After each attack the player character gains a 50% boost to their attack
5. The player wins by defeating all the opponents or loses if their character's HP reaches 0
